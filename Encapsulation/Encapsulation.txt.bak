Encapsulation in Java
======================


Why do we use encapsulation? What is the benefit of it?

What is modularity?

----

Improves security of an objectâ€™s internal state by hiding it from the outside world.
Increases modularity and maintainability by making it easier to change the implementation without affecting other parts of the code.
Enables data abstraction, allowing objects to be treated as a single unit.
Allows for easy addition of new methods and fields without affecting the existing code.
Supports the object-oriented principle of information hiding, making it easier to change the implementation without affecting the rest of the code.
